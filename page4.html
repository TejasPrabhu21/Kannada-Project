                <p>Karnataka has an enthralling history. This state lying in the southern part of India has been under
                    the rule of several
                    dynasties that have shaped its history. It has been invaded by a number of rulers at different
                    points of time in
                    history. Due to the influence of various rulers and dynasties Karnataka became enriched with their
                    distinctive culture
                    and values.In the ancient times Karnataka was known as Karunadu which means elevated land or high
                    plateau. The history of Karnataka
                    can be traced back to the prehistoric days.

                <p>The pre-historic culture of Karnataka was very different from that of the northern part of India.
                    During the
                    pre-historic times the hand-axe culture was prevalent in Karnataka. This culture was similar to the
                    pre-historic culture
                    of Africa. The use of iron was known to the inhabitants of Karnataka even before 1200 B.C. This was
                    far earlier than the
                    time when the inhabitants of North India came to know about the use of iron.

                <p>The early rulers of Karnataka were from the northern parts of the country. During the 4th and 3rd
                    century BCE parts of
                    Karnataka was under the rule of the Maurya and Nanda Empire of North India. After the fall of the
                    Mauryan Empire the
                    Satavahana dynasty came to power in Karnataka around 3 BCE. They ruled over extensive parts of
                    Northern Karnataka,
                    Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Prakrit was their administrative language. Both Kannada and Telugu
                    were found and
                    evolved during their rule. The Satavahana dynasty ruled over Karnataka for almost 300 years.

                    The weakening of the Satavahana dynasty resulted in the Pallavas of Kanchi becoming the political
                    power in Karnataka for
                    a brief period of time. The domination of the Pallavas was brought to an end by indigenous
                    dynasties, the Kadambas of
                    Banavasi and the Gangas of Kolar. The ascent of the Kadamba dynasty and the Western Ganga Dynasty
                    marked the starting
                    point of Karnataka becoming an independent political entity.

                <p>The Kadambas are regarded as the earliest royal dynasty of Karnataka. The dynasty was founded by
                    Mayurasharma. This
                    dynasty ruled over North Karnataka and the Konkan from Banavasi. The Kadambas were the first rulers
                    to use Kannada
                    language at the administrative level. They also minted gold coins and contributed to the
                    architectural heritage of
                    Karnataka.

                    The Kadambas ruled Karnataka for more than 200 years before Chalukyas overtook their empire. But
                    some minor branches of
                    the Kadamba dynasty continued to rule Hanagal, Goa and some other regions till 14th century.

                <p>The Ganga Dynasty initially ruled from Kolar and later moved their capital to Talakad. This dynasty
                    is referred to as
                    Western Ganga to distinguish them from The Eastern Ganga dynasty that in later centuries dominated
                    over Kalinga (present
                    day Odisha). Their reign extended over Southern Karnataka, parts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.
                    They laid a strong
                    foundation for the development of Kannada literature.

                    The Gangas constructed several monuments. The Gomateshwara statue in Shravanabelagola, constructed
                    around 983 AD, is the
                    tallest monolith statue in the world and is considered to be the most famous Ganga architecture.

                    The Ganga dynasty ruled for about 700 years and were a sovereign power till the advent of the Badami
                    Chalukyas. They
                    continued to rule under the Badami Chalukyas and the Rastrakutas till the end of the 10th century.

                <p>The Chalukya dynasty was founded by Pulakeshin. The earliest dynasty was known as Badami Chalukyas
                    and they ruled from
                    Vatapi (present day Badami). The Chalukyas of Badami were instrumental in bringing the whole of
                    Karnataka under a single
                    rule. They contributed heavily in the fields of art and architecture.

                    The Badami Chalukyas were responsible for changing the political atmosphere in South India, shifting
                    from small kingdoms
                    to large empires. The Chalukyas ruled over most of Karnataka and Maharashtra and parts of Andhra
                    Pradesh, Madhya
                    Pradesh, Odisha and Gujarat. The rise of the Rashtrakutas eclipsed the reign of the Badami
                    Chalukyas.

                </div>
                <p>The Rastrakuta dynasty was founded by Dantivarman or Dantidurga II. The Elichpur clan owed feudal
                    allegiance to the
                    Badami Chalukyas. During the dominion of Dantidurga, the clan toppled Chalukya Kirtivarman II and
                    built an empire
                    keeping the Gulbarga region in present day Karnataka as their base. This clan was later known as the
                    Rastrakutas of
                    Manyakheta.

                    According to an Arabic text, Silsilat al-Tawarikh (851), the Rastrakutas were regarded as one of the
                    four principal
                    empires of the world. This dynasty ruled over all of Karnataka and Maharashtra and large parts of
                    Andhra Pradesh, Madhya
                    Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. During their rule architecture flourished. The world famous Kailash Temple
                    at Ellora was built
                    by the Rastrakutas. The era of the Badami Chalukyas and Rastrakutas is considered as the “Age of
                    Imperial Karnataka”.

                <p>The Chalukyas of Kalyana came to power after they overthrew the Rastrakutas in 973 AD. Their ruler,
                    Someshwara I built
                    his capital at Kalyana (present day Basava Kaluyana in Bidar district). The Kalyana Chalukya dynasty
                    is also known as
                    the Western Chalukya dynasty to differentiate them from the Eastern Chalukya dynasty of Vengi. This
                    dynasty ruled over
                    entire Karnataka and Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

                    During their rule literature flourished in Karnataka as the Chalukyas were patrons of art and
                    architecture. The Mahadeva
                    temple at Itagi (in present day Raichur district) is considered to be the finest Chalukyan
                    monument.The rulers of the Kalachuri dynasty overtook their empire and reigned for about 20 years
                    but could not uphold the
                    integrity of the empire. This led to the empire becoming weak and finally it broke up and was shared
                    by Sevunas in the
                    north and Hoysalas in the south.

                <p>The Sevuna dynasty established their rule when the Kalyana Chalukya dynasty’s power waned. The
                    Sevunas were once the
                    feudatories of the Rashtrakutas and then of the Western Chalukyas before they declared independence.
                    The founder of the
                    Sevuna dynasty was Dridhaprahara. This dynasty is also known as Seuna or Yadavas of Devagiri as they
                    had their capital
                    at Devagiri (present day Daulatabad in Maharashtra). They ruled over northern Karnataka, parts of
                    Andhra Pradesh and
                    most of Maharashtra.

                    The dynasty was immortalised in history by the writings of the celebrated mathematician
                    Baskarasharya, the famous
                    scholar Hemadri and the great writer on music, Sharngadeva. The rulers of this dynasty were
                    constantly in fight with the
                    rulers of the Hoysala dynasty. The dynasty finally fell to the sultan of Delhi, Allah-ud-din Khilji
                    and his general
                    Mallikaffar.

                <p>The Hoysala Empire was found by a legendary individual called Sala. He became famous for killing a
                    tiger in order to
                    rescue his master and thus the empire was named as Hoysala (meaning to shoot it or to hit it). The
                    Hoysalas initially
                    had their capital at Belur but later shifted it to Halebidu. This dynasty ruled over southern
                    Karnataka, parts of Andhra
                    Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

                    The Hoysala era saw significant development of art, architecture and religion in South India. They
                    became famous for
                    their temple architecture. The world-famous Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at
                    Halebidu, and the
                    Kesava Temple at Somanathapura are examples of their sculptural exuberance. Even today there are
                    more than a hundred
                    temples scattered across Karnataka that were built by the Hoysalas. They also encouraged literature
                    to flourish in
                    Kannada and Sanskrit. The era saw the emergence of great Kannada poets like Rudrabhatta, Raghavanka,
                    Harihara and Janna.

                    Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, entire Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This empire was famous for its power and
                    wealth.

                    The rulers of this empire enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada,
                    Sanskrit, Tamil and Telugu.
                    Carnatic music evolved during this era. The empire’s legacy included several astounding monuments
                    spread across South
                    India. Some of the best known remnants of Vijayanagara Empire’s architectural prowess can be seen at
                    the Group of
                    Monuments at Hampi, which is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Stone Chariot in Hampi
                    is a brilliant
                    example of the Vijayanagara style of architecture. The Vijayanagara Empire’s power declined after it
                    was defeated in the
                    battle of Talikota in 1565 AD by the Deccan Sultanates.

                <p>The Bahmani Empire (also known as Bahmanid Empire or Bahmani Sultanate) was the first independent
                    Islamic Kingdom in
                    South India. The Bahmani Empire was established by Turkic or Brahmin convert Ala-ud-Din Hassan
                    Bahman Shah. It was
                    considered to be one of the great medieval kingdoms of India. The empire’s rule extended over
                    northern Karnataka and
                    Andhra Pradesh. The empire collapsed after the last remnant of the Bahmani Sultanate was defeated by
                    Krishnadevaraya of
                    the Vijayanagara Empire.

                    After 1518 the Bahmani Sultanate got divided into five states, namely: Nizamshahi of Ahmednagar,
                    Qutubshahi of Golconda
                    (Hydrabad), Baridshahi of Bidar, Imadshahi of Berar, Adilshahi of Bijapur. Together they are known
                    as the Deccan
                    Sultanates.

                <p>The Adilshahi was a Shia Muslim dynasty that was founded by Yusuf Adil Shah and the dynasty ruled
                    over the Sultanate of
                    Bijapur. Their rule extended over Bijapur and the adjoining areas. Bijapur was a great centre of
                    learning in that era.
                    During the rule of Bijapur Sultanate Islamic architecture flourished in the region. The Gol Gumbaz
                    in Bijapur is the
                    most famous monument built during their reign. The Bijapur Sultanate was conquered by Emperor
                    Aurangzeb and it was
                    absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1686 AD.

                    By 1686 the kingdom’s
                    reign included almost all of south India. In 1687 AD the Wodeyars bought the city of Bangalore from

                    three lakh rupees. The Wodeyar Kingdom was overtaken by Hyder Ali by 1761 AD.

                    Kerela. The Kingdom
                    of Mysore reached their height of military power and dominion under the de facto ruler Haider Ali
                    and his son Tipu
                    Sultan during the latter part of the 18th century.

                    Tipu Sultan repelled the attack from the British many times. Finally he was defeated due to the
                    united efforts of
                    British, Maratha and Hyderabad Nijamas and was killed on the battle field in 1799 AD. Due to his

                    field Tipu Sultan is known as the Tiger of Mysore.

                    that time the cry
                    for independence from British rule had gained much momentum across the country. The rule of the
                    Wodeyars continued till
                    India’s independence in 1947. After independence Mysore merged with the Indian union. Thus, Mysore
                    became an independent
                    state in 1950.

                    Under the Wodeyars, Mysore became one of the modern and urbanized regions of India. The rulers of
                    the Wodeyar dynasty
