                <p>This is one festival all of us know about. It is the day that we celebrate in devotion to Lord
                    Ganesha, son of Lord
                    Shiva and Parvati. All of us know the story of how Lord Ganesha was created. The festival is
                    celebrated over a period of
                    10 days, it begins on the 4th day of the waxing moon period(Shukla Chaturthi) and ends on the 14th
                    day of the waxing
                    moon period(Anant Chaturdashi) in the month of August or September.

                    In public places, clay idols of Lord Ganesha are placed in all the holy shrines and prayed upon
                    while in the houses a
                    small area of the house is cleaned and the idol is placed and prayed upon. The main sweet dish of
                    this festival is the
                    Modak which is a dumpling that is made from rice/wheat flour and stuffed with coconut, jaggery,
                    dried fruits etc.
                    Another sweet dish is Karanji which is also similar to the modak.
                    This festival is very sacred to the Hindus. On this festival four main rituals are performed which
                    are as follows:

                    Prana Pratishtha: It is when Lord Ganesha is asked to come inside the Murthi or idol

                    Shodashopachara: It is the 16 ways to pay tribute to Lord Ganesha

                    Uttar Puja: It is the puja after which Lord Ganesha has entered the Murthi and can now be
                    shifted.The murthi of Ganesha is shifted in the houses and offered fruits and other sweets.
                    Ganpati Visarjan : This is when the murthi or idol of Lord Ganesha is immersed into the river body
                    be it a lake, pond or
                    the sea.

                    with lots of flowers
                    and fresh mango leaves. A significant event in temples and homes during the celebrations is the

                <p>Performed on a full moon day the Karaga is a folk dance performed as a ritual dedicated to Draupadi.
                    It is one of the
                    oldest festivals performed in the Bengaluru. It is led by the men because in the last part of
                    Mahabharatha the demon
                    Tripurasura was still alive and Draupadi took the form of a shakti goddess and created soldiers
                    called Veerakumaras.
                    After the war, the soldiers asked her to stay but she couldn’t, so she promised to come to visit
                    them on the first full
                    moon of the Hindu Calendar.

                    There is a Karaga carrier, dressed up as a woman carries the Karaga which is a pyramid covered in
                    flowers and visits all
                    the Veerakumaras in his temporary Devi State. Nobody knows what is inside the Karaga, the carrier
                    balances it very well
                    on his and is not to drop it or else will die as is believed. The Karaga returns to the temple the
                    next day by dawn.

                    The Karaga festival is a beautiful festival which sees the respect and loves the people have for
                    Draupadi, the Shakti
                    Devi.

                    celebrations definitely
                    step it up a notch. Chamundeshwari, an incarnation of goddess Parvati killed the demon Mahishasura
                    during this period to
                    mark the triumph of the good over evil.In 15th Century, the kings of the Vijayanagara empire started
                    the practice of celebrating it with a lot of show and
                    pomp. This tradition has continued till this day and Mysore Dasara became the state festival of
                    Karnataka. The Mysore
                    Palace is lit up during this period with a hundred thousand bulbs and there is a carnival-like
                    atmosphere across the
                    city. The highlight is the ninth day of the festival (called Mahanavami) when a massive procession
                    with elephants and
                    dancers is taken out in the streets of the city. There is also an exhibition organised by the state

                    crown on the deity’s head in the evening upon which a grand procession is taken out. This procession
                    goes on until wee

                    The Tula Sankramana is the first day of the Kodava community’s Toleyar month. River Cauvery holds a
                    special significance
                    and is revered by the Kannadiga population. It is believed that the goddess Cauvery rises from the
                    water on this day to
                    bless her devotees. On this day, thousands of people throng near the Talacauvery river to witness
                    the water levels rise.
                    Following this, they take a dip in the holy river as it is considered auspicious.

                    It is usually held on the 17th day of October and around 100,000 devotees from various parts of
                    Karnataka gather in the
                    Kodagu district to participate in the festivities.
