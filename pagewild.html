                <p>Located 22 km away from Bangalore, the Bannerghatta National Park is a sanctuary for a large variety
                    of flora and fauna.
                    Spread over a massive area of around 104.27 sq. km, this national park was established in the year
                    1971. The park itself
                    has a number of establishments within its confines, which includes the country's first butterfly
                    park as well.

                    personal with the wondrous wildlife here by the means of a jungle safari, which is a popular

                    The best part about Bannerghatta National Park is the small well-defined zones for animals that
                    almost guarantees that
                    you will spot the animals. People go in caged vehicles (buses/safari).

                <p>Situated in Karnataka, Bandipur National Park was once the hunting grounds of the Maharaja of Mysore.
                    It was later
                    established as a reserve in 1974 under Project Tiger and these deciduous forests rich in wildlife

                    tourist attraction since then. It is 80 km from Mysore enroute Ooty in Tamil Nadu. Due to a lot of
                    wildlife casualties
                    because of speeding vehicles that go through the park, a ban on traffic between 9 PM to 6 AM has
                    been established to
                    ensure the safety of the animals of the park.

                    It is located in the Nilgiris and is the first Biosphere Reserve in India. Spread over 874 sq km,
                    the park is replete
                    with a wide range of endangered wildlife like elephants, hornbills, deers, pythons, sloth bears,
                    pythons, panthers etc.

                    status of a national
                    park in the year 1987, the 600-kilometre square area is one of the most well preserved national
                    parks in the state. The
                    Kudremukh National Park is jewelled with natural beauty, high rising peaks studded with a plethora
                    of flora and fauna to
                    picturesque trekking routes overseeing verdant grasslands, there is much to experience here! The
                    wildlife protected area
                    is the second-largest belonging to a tropical wet evergreen forest in the zone of the Western Ghats.

                    The area gains its name from the native language. Kudremukha translates to horse-face, referring to
                    the highest mountain
                    peak in the park which resembles the face of a horse from a particular side. It rises to a height of
                    1,894 meters (6,214
                    feet) and is the second highest peak in Karnataka. The area is the habitat of many endangered and
                    endemic species of
                    plants and animals, with mammals such as tigers, leopards and wild dogs as the primary predators of
                    the region.

                    Primarily developed as an important iron-ore mining town, conservationists successfully campaigned
                    against the adverse
                    mining effects on the environment. Kudremukh and its lush green surroundings are a nature and
                    wildlife lover's paradise,
                    serving you the best of Western Ghats in great detail.
